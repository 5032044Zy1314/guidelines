# Vaccination Guide
One can get vaccinated in Sweden without personal number, and can still obtain the *EU Digital COVID Certificate* (EU COVID-19 Vaccine Passport).

## What to bring
Your passport. It is also highly recommended that you take the vaccine **AFTER** obtaining local phone number. 

## What to prepare
If you have been vaccinated in your home country, prepare the English name of the vaccine you have taken, and the time of vaccination. These information can help the doctor to determine whether you need to get vaccinated again and which vaccine you should take.

## Where to get vaccination
**[Min Doktor Vård & Vaccin](https://www.mindoktor.se/)** (My Doctor Care & Vaccine), usually located in an **Apotek Hjärtat** (The Heart Pharmacy, their logo contains ICA since it is purchased by ICA Group), but not every Apotek Hjärtat has one.
There is a [Min Doktor Vård & Vaccin](https://www.mindoktor.se/kliniken/nordstan/) in the [Apotek Hjärtat in Nordstan](https://www.apotekhjartat.se/hitta-apotek-hjartat/vastra-gotaland/apotek_hjartat_nordstan_goteborg/), located near the entrance between Scandic Europa and Hotel Opera. The address is Götgatan 12, 411 05 Göteborg. Or you can search *Min Doktor Vård & Vaccin* for more convenient location.

## Notes
1. If you don't have personal number, you need to talk to the staff of Min Doktor Vård & Vaccin to get a waiting number.
2. There is no doctor there, only nurses. They will ask you for your vaccination history. Answer the questions honestly. The nurse may need to call a doctor for instructions.
3. Leave enough time. There aren't many people waiting, but the time for one person to get vaccinated can be quite long. 
4. After the vaccination, you will get a paper card with the vaccination information on it. You can take the second dose at other places. I am not sure whether it is strictly required to bring the paper card with you when taking the 2nd dose since the information is stored in the system. but it is highly **recommended** to do so.  After taking the second dose, you can get the vaccine passport.
