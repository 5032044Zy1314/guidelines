Notice: You can book a photoshoot time before you receive the letter. If you haven't received it 2 days before the appointment, you can use the dialog box on the right to change the appointment time. This will save some time.

##### Before taking the photo, you need to pay the card production fee according to the payment method specified in the letter. Approximate 400 kroner.

##### Then go to "Skattekontoret" again to take a picture. After about 2 months, you can get an ID card. Then apply for a bank card with your ID card. Send the bank card number to Ola and cc to CJ by E-mail.
