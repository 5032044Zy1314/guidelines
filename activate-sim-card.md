# How to activate SIM card
Please note that diffrent telecom operators may have different ways to activate SIM cards. Here we only illustrate how to activate SIM cards of Tre (Three) company. For other operators, please refer to their websites.
1. Insert the SIM card into your cell phone.
2. Power on the cell phone. Enter the PIN number when you are prompted to. The PIN number can be found on the back of the phone card. [This page](https://forum.hallon.se/sim-kort-60/pin-puk-kod-193) in Hallon forum contains an example of Hallon SIM card (Sorry I can't find a suitable one for TRE :joy:).
3. Make a phone call to a Swedish phone number. Please note that all Sweden national numbers start with one leading 0 and be sure to dial the leading 0. People may omit the leading 0 when giving it out, but you can't omit it when dialing the number.
4. Now the SIM card is activated.
